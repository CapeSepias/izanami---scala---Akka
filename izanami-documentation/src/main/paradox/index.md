Izanami is a shared configuration service well-suited for micro-service architecture implementation. In addition to shared configuration, Izanami provides feature flipping and A/B Testing. Izanami provides a UI to allow non-tech users to toggle features and to handle A/B testing.

Izanami also provides first class integration. We provide Java, Scala, Node and React clients to integrate with your apps. We also provide webhook integration.
